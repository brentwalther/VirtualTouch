# VirtualTouch

A Texas A&M University CSCE-656 project.

For the VirtualTouch project, we aim to create a mobile application that allows a user to search and play Youtube videos and then record “touch tracks” at the same time the video is playing. In the case of a user looking to record, they would connect a bluetooth recording device (or press a button on screen) when they desire to record a touch event anytime during the playback of a Youtube video of their choice. Then, another user with the playback hardware (a bluetooth enabled vibrating arm band) could play the video again and receive the vibrations synchronized with the playback of the video.
